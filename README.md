# React Portfolio

  ## Description
  
  * Disclaimer:  Portfolio isn't yet fully responsive and more animations will be added using framer motion
  * Deployed Link: https://jmaduafo.github.io/Portfolio-Version-2
    
  For my portfolio, I wanted to show my skills in using React, but I also wanted to create a website that's personal to me and conveys my personality and my design sense well. I intend to add animations very soon to enhance user experience and to elevate the website further. Furthermore, I wanted it to look professional but not too conventional in order for it to stand out. I was inspired greatly by awwwards.com, and my goal was to create a website that would look like it would be on there. The portfolio includes a Home, About, Works, Contact, and Resume section and I believe that going through these pages would give the user a good idea of who I am.

  ## Installation

  To install the application, the user must run "npm start" but in order to create a React app, you must input "npx create-react-app your-app-name". React would then create a slew of files and folders necessary to get your app up and running.
  
  ## Usage
  
  This application should only be used to view and contact. I'd like for my application to give other developers working on their portfolios an idea of what to include in their portfolio if they're stuck or are out of ideas. I also want my portfolio to showcase my strengths and skills and hopefully helps me gain exposure.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
